## Introduction:
In our world, standards are what keep us civilized. Standards are the glue that keeps the world together, ensuring that it continues running. Without standards or rules, chaos reigns supreme. And the same goes for coding.

## Standards In Coding:
In the English language, we have grammar standards that allow us to effectively and efficiently communicate. Because coding is another form of communication, we have rules that help with clarity. Disregarding grammar or coding rules hinders our ability to understand each other. People might say that some standards are unnecessary, such as the amount of spaces to indent or whether to put a closing curly brace on a new line. While these things may seem small, there are much greater benefits that come from it.

In my Software Engineering class, we practiced using a stricter standard using ESLint with IntelliJ. At first, I found this change to be funny as I saw all my code light up with red error markings, indicating that the code was not up to standards. I spent a good five minutes fixing my mistakes, but the end result was magnificent. Not only did it look pretty, but having the text standardized made it clean, clear, and easy to read. Managing code was made easier after this revelation and made me more conscious about what I write.

When I look back at my first-ever big coding project, something sticks out to me. My coding standard was terrible! Inconsistent spacing, unneeded empty lines, and, worst of all, bad variable names. It was difficult to follow at times. Similar to English, having bad coding standards is like having bad sentences lacking punctuation and nonsensical words thrown in.

## Conclusion:
Although not everyone agrees on a single standard, having them is better than nothing. While it was challenging to adjust to a new way of coding, the end product is better and cleaner to boot. Just as grammar rules make language coherent, coding standards make software comprehensible.
