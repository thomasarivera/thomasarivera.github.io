## Reusable Takeout Program App
### By: Aaron Lander Ancheta, Nathaniel Murray, Jaren Pinera, Thomas Rivera, Sage Suzuki

## Overview:
Full Cycle Takeout, a non-profit operating a reusable takeout container program, is looking to replace single-use plats/clamshells at events. Currently, in the trial phase of the program, 20 to 30% of containers are not returned, making the program unsustainable for the planet and finances. Full Cycle Takeout is looking for a solution to keep customers accountable for returning reusables efficiently for fast-moving events. Solutions include making an application that collects collateral, such as money, that would then be refunded upon the return of the reusable. The application would also need to track the resusables and their owners. Since this is meant for large events, annoyances, and inconveniences should be minimized for the user.
