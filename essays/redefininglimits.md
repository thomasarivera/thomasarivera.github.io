## Introduction:
Nothing is more exciting than learning a new programming language: In this case, it is JavaScript. It starts with a simple “Hello World.” almost like the program welcomes me; However, it's all a facade. Like many other tutorials, what hides behind the excitement is hours of boring text. Despite this, the end result makes it all the more rewarding.

## Is It Any Good?:
Learning Javascript was a fun experience and showed me what is possible when not bound by a single language. In my very short experience with coding, I found that learning new languages is simple. The idea of programming is fundamental and can be used in various settings, not just computers. So, with only some syntax changes, JavaScript was quickly added to my repertoire. 

All of my learning took place on FreeCodeCamp. It has been an excellent resource and teaches it in an easy-to-understand way. One of the few changes that caught my attention is the importance of data types or lack of it. In most languages I’ve used, such as Java and C, variables must be paired with a data type. However, in JavaScript, variables are created dynamically. Instead of using an int value to store only an integer, JavaScript uses var, let, or const, allowing for different types of data to be stored. For example, by making a variable “x” in JavaScript, I can assign it any type of value: integer, string, boolean, whatever!

With the lack of strict rules, I found myself being able to quickly code and solve problems. Although, that is not to say it’s all good. One drawback of these relaxed variables is the possibility of more errors in variable typing. While languages such as Java and C can be strict, this strictness is also a net that catches the user from making simple variable-type mistakes. I experienced this while learning. After I created a variable for a string, I then accidentally assigned that variable to an integer, which broke my program.

I always hear people say that one programming language is better than the other, but that is not true at all. Programming languages are a tool, and some tools are better for a particular job. I found JavaScript to be easy to pick up and has a good stream of thought to code workflow. So, yes, JavaScript is great!

## Learn Quick or Fail Quick:
My Fall 2023 semester has already begun with a massive wave of work, but that’s not to say I’m not excited. ICS 314 Software Engineering is one of the classes I’ve been looking forward to since attending UH Manoa, and I’m ready for the challenge. Attempting my first couple of Work Outs of the Days (WODs) was, to put it lightly, a massive failure. Not only did I not finish in time, but I also didn’t get a working solution. Seeing my results made me stressed out. However, I know failure is a part of life, and it’s also a major component of learning. By studying and practicing more often, I know I can improve to become faster. This is only my first step towards success. 

## Moving Forward:
I’ve learned a lot just within these first two weeks. There’s much to cover and much more to learn. Although I feel as though I am a bit setback, I’m determined to succeed and become an even stronger programmer.
