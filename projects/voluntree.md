## Problem:
In Hawaii, the absence of a streamlined, accessible platform for volunteers and philanthropists presents a significant challenge. The lack of local infrastructure makes it difficult for individuals to find and engage in volunteer opportunities effectively. Consequently, there's a disconnect between those eager to help and the communities in need.

## Our Solution:
Voluntree is a simple, easy-to-use interface that allows users to post and commit to events quickly. It manages and matches willing volunteers with nonprofits and other organizations.

## Discovering Events:
Users can freely browse available events without needing an account, search by keywords, or filter by category. To participate in an event, they simply need to click on the event card and select the “Commit” button.
